# 🔐 Secure E-Learning Platform - Vulnerability Assessment, Mitigation, and Secure Design Patterns

## 📚 Overview

This project enhances a vulnerable educational course website by identifying, analyzing, and mitigating critical web application vulnerabilities, along with implementing secure software design patterns in Java and conducting penetration testing on the Mutillidae vulnerable web app.

### 🚨 Key Components

1. **Threat Modeling & Analysis**
2. **PHP Vulnerability Mitigation**
3. **Java Secure Design Patterns**
4. **Penetration Testing (Mutillidae via Burp Suite)**

---

## 1️⃣ Threat Modeling

Performed using the **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**, the process involved:

- **Asset Identification**
- **Architecture Design & Technology Stack**
- **Application Decomposition (Trust Boundaries, Data Flows)**
- **STRIDE Threat Analysis**
- **DREAD Risk Rating**
- **Security Profile Documentation**
- **Bonus: Attack Trees for Two Major Threats**

## 2️⃣ Web Security Mitigation (PHP)

Applied mitigations to a [vulnerable educational site](https://github.com/salmaelkaddy/Vulnerable-Educational-Website):

- 🔒 **SQL Injection Protection**  
  Used prepared statements (PDO/MySQLi) to sanitize user input.

- 🛡️ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**  
  Implemented input sanitization and output escaping using `htmlspecialchars()`.

- 🔑 **Password Hashing**  
  Replaced plaintext password storage with secure password hashing using `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`.

## 3️⃣ Java Secure Design Patterns

Implemented secure patterns on a Java-based GUI e-learning system:
[Source System](https://github.com/SuwaidAslam/E-Learning-System-Java-GUI-Application)

### ✔️ Secure Logger
- `SecureLogger`, `EncryptLogger`, and `SecureLoggerFactory`
- Logs critical events while hiding sensitive data.

### ✔️ Secure Factory Pattern
- User access control via abstract factories for:
  - `Student`
  - `Instructor`
  - `Administrator`

- Classes:
  - `SensitiveDBFactory`, `LessSensitiveDBFactory`
  - `AbstractDBFactory`, `SecurityCredentials`

## 4️⃣ Penetration Testing (Mutillidae)

Used **Burp Suite** to test and exploit vulnerabilities on the Mutillidae vulnerable web app (Metasploitable 2):

### 🧪 Tests Conducted:
- **Spidering & Target Scoping**
- **SQL Injection** (with Intruder & manual payloads)
- **XSS** (Reflected and Stored)
- **Brute Force Attacks**

### 📊 Findings Reported:
- Exploit screenshots
- Proof-of-Concept attacks
- Risk impact and remediation suggestions
